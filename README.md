{
"model": [
  {
  "name": "location",
  "field: [
    ["id", "integer", "ID", "required"],
    ["name", "string", "Name", "required"],
    ["status", "integer", "Status", "required"],

    ["name", "string", "Name", "required"],
    ["email", "string", "Email", "required"],
    ["status", "integer", "Status", "required"],

add view page (you need to generate this from configuration.json. If there are more fields, should generate it)
<form method="POST" action="Thank you for your business! We look forward to working with you again.api/location">
<label>Name</label>
<input type="text" name="name" id="name" value="" required/>
